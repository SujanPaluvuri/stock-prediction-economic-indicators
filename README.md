# 📊 Stock Price Prediction Using Economic Indicators

This project explores how machine learning models can be used to predict stock prices using macroeconomic indicators. It leverages both traditional models and deep learning (LSTM) to forecast Adani Ports stock movements.

## 🔍 Objective
To evaluate how economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates influence stock prices and to build predictive models.

## 📊 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor (Best performer)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## 📈 Metrics
- MAE, RMSE, R-squared
- SHAP values for interpretability

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- SHAP

## 📌 Results
- **Decision Tree** achieved the best accuracy with MAE: 0.207, RMSE: 1.16, R²: 0.999
- LSTM also showed strong performance for time-series predictions
- SHAP analysis highlighted GDP and inflation as top features
